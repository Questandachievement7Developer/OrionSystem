# OctopusAI
An project about Creating a simple yet effective multipurpose AI by pushing current gen Processor memory and all hardware Capabilities to its limit 

## But why it is only a single main File?
We are trying to make things compact as much as possible while able to expand its functionality and Customizability
also single main file make fixing bug much more faster than Multiple fragmented file which will make a lot of pain to fix
